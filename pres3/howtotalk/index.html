                #### Can you say something?

            </section>
            <section data-markdown>
                #### Great!
                #### You can talk
                #### We're almost done

            <section data-markdown>
                ## Why
            </section>

            <section data-markdown>
                ### Sharing is growing

                * when you speak about something you know, you explore it better for yourself
                * other people **will** tell you something interesting about it
                * best ideas come from discussions
                * it does stuff to your career :)
                * only way to fight the fear of public speaking is to try
            </section>
            <section data-markdown>
                ##### People are nice and they want to hear you

                There's nothing to worry about. There's no difference between talking to 10 or 100 of them.
            </section>

            <section data-markdown>
                ## What
            </section>

            <section data-markdown>
                ##### When speaking, tell a story
                ![story](story.jpg)
            </section>

            <section data-markdown>
                ### Story?

                What if it's technical knowledge, not a story?

                Well, I mean tell something that:
                * has a beginnging
                * is complete
                * is your own experience
                * is about you or about something
            </section>
            <section data-markdown>
                * Raise awareness, inspire
                * Teach people something they can't google faster
                * Tell people something they were not aware about
                * Share your experience
            </section>

            <section data-markdown>
                ## How
            </section>

            <section data-markdown>
                ### Prepare some visuals

                1. So that you don't forget what's next
                2. So that they can remember or go back to it
                3. Some things are easier to type than say
                4. You need to put links somewhere
            </section>

            <section data-markdown>
                ### Don't think in powerpoint

                Never start with creating a ppt or keynote file.

                * Make notes on real paper.
                * You can do with 10 tabs in the browser.
                * You can scroll a document.

            </section>
            <section data-markdown>
                ### Never read from the slides

                It makes you redundant
            </section>
            <section data-markdown>
                ### Live demos are great

                 If people don't have to listen to you type in total silence.

                ### Always cheat when live coding

                ![live coding deception requires](deception.jpg)

                * git commits for steps
                * tabs with results already loaded
                * a file with all commands you'll use

            </section>
            <section data-markdown>
                ### Time it

                Don't practice. You're not on a TED stage.

                Just try it once out loud to see if it's not 3 times longer than you thought.

                ## Make your own rules

                It's good to be different. Just make sure you know how to do the normal thing first.
